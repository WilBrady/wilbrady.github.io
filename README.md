# Wil Brady's Articles of Interest
I am a Microsoft engineering manager and am gathering articles, roughly categorized, that may be helpful/beneficial for your career. Some resources are only availabe to Microsoft employess as that was my primary audience but most are public links. The [mslibrary](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/mslibrary/) is a great resource for getting access to more content and access to many journals and services such as the [Harvard Business Review](https://aka.ms/hbr) while on corp net. I tried to rank these articles with a `1`-Great! to `5`-OK rating (I did not even bother adding articles I thought were not helpful).

## Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity and Inclusion is a core part of Microsoft culture, and I believe vital to any company's success. It is critical to creating a safe and effective team where everyone's thoughts are heard. Listening to a diverse group of people leads to better products and a better bottom line but it takes effort. Diversity is a fact, Inclusion is an act.

2 - [The Value of Belonging at Work](https://hbr.org/2019/12/the-value-of-belonging-at-work) (December 16th 2019) _"If workers feel like they belong, companies reap substantial bottom-line benefits: better job performance, lower turnover risk, and fewer sick days." This articles shares studies on inclusion and exclusion of coworkers and the impact of exclusion, specifically excluded people working less for team benefit. Suggestions for countering inclusion - 1. Gaining perspective, 2. Encouraging Mentorship, 3. Finding empowerment - are discussed. For leaders and managers, "serving as a fair-minded ally — someone who treats everyone equally" can prevent exclusionary behaviors. Being included is critical!_

## Learn from others

[I.M. Wright’s “Hard Code” – An opinion column for developers. Brutally honest, no pulled punches.](https://imwrightshardcode.com/)
Up until September 2020 ([Fond farewell to Microsoft](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2020/09/fond-farewell-to-microsoft/)), Eric Brechner wrote these articles within Microsoft, and you could get a monthly email from him. Most of these are very Microsoft focused, and throughout my career have come up or been shared. While sometimes his writing is a little harsh, it is honest and insightful. The following are a few that came up in discussions in my past that I thought were worth calling out.
